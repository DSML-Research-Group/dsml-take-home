# Codesmith Take Home Challenge

For this take home challenge you will be using foundational data science python libraries to analyze a dataset related to diabetes patients and develop a basic logistic regression model.

The libraries we will be using are:
 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
 - [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
 - [Matplotlib](https://www.w3schools.com/python/matplotlib_pyplot.asp)

The data is collected from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset and provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/diabetes-prediction-competitiontfug-chd-nov-2022/data). You can view the raw data [here](./data).

Submit your answers to the prompts [here](https://forms.gle/66VdMARikw7BAYs97)
